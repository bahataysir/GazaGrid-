## Project Overview

**GazaGrid** is a research-oriented platform that combines **Quantum Computing** with **Classical AI** to solve the **NP-hard problem of optimal renewable energy site selection in conflict zones**.

This project introduces a **Quantum–Classical Hybrid Optimization framework**, leveraging the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** to support **humanitarian energy infrastructure planning** under extreme constraints such as risk, accessibility, and grid distance.

> **Key Contribution:**  
> This is the **first known application of QAOA** to renewable energy planning in humanitarian and conflict-affected regions.
